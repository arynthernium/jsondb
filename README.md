# jsonDB
A database project storing things in one big JSON file. (soon more than one file will be supported.)

Terrible practice. Never going to be useful.



# Packages
Uses ExpressJS, dotenv, and socket.io.

# TODO
- [x] Read JSON from file and send it to the client
- [x] Login with password, checking against password stored in environment variable
- [x] Full entry viewer
- [x] Make new entries
- [x] Generate IDs randomly
- [ ] Multiple tables
- [ ] API instead of GUI interaction (important)
	- [x] GET tables
	- [x] GET entries from specific tables
	- [ ] POST new table entries
	- [ ] POST new table creation
