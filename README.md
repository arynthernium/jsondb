# jsonDB
A database project storing things in one big JSON file.

Terrible practice. Never going to be useful.



# Packages
Uses ExpressJS, dotenv, and socket.io.

# TODO
- [x] Read JSON from file and send it to the client
- [x] Login with password, checking against password stored in environment variable
- [ ] Display full JSON entry on call
- [ ] Make new entries
- [ ] Generate IDs randomly
